Additive manufacturing presents an opportunity to create architectured materials with design parameters with tailorable stiffness and damping. A key application explored are rotordynamic bearing supports, a core component of aerospace engines. Supplemented with analytical models and rotordynamics softwares, a jeffcott rotor rig is used to study the instabilities and behaviour that are affected by different materials including those we printed with laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) in 316SS. Discussion of looseness on the rotordynamic rig is explored by analysis of the FFT spectra. Interpenetrating lattices (IPLs) are presented as to be integrated with the bearing supports and studied in simulation and compressive testing destructively with a hydraulic press and non-destructively with Laser Induced Resonant Acoustic Spectroscopy (LIRAS) to gain data on the mechanical properties, relating them to its design. The findings in this thesis: 1) advise the next steps in integrating the bearing supports and IPLs, 2) verify which models are useful for IPLs, and 3) provide a first look at the ability of LIRAS measurements to study the dynamic response of IPLs.
